# Annual-income-vs-spending-score-using-K-Means-Clustering
Problem Statement- Gucci, the renowned Italian luxury brand, is planning to open a new boutique in a high-end shopping mall. As part of their grand opening, 
they want to create a buzz and attract the right clientele to their store. They've partnered with the mall's management to use targeted marketing strategies to maximize their 
reach and effectiveness. As the data analyst for the mall, you have access to a comprehensive database of mall visitors, which includes details such as annual income, spending 
scores (indicating how much they spend in the mall and how often), visit frequency, and purchase history. Your task is to analyze this data to identify the ideal customers for Gucci's targeted marketing campaign. The goal is to send personalized push notifications to these customers, informing them about Gucci's new store opening, exclusive offers, and perhaps an invite to a special inaugural event. Given Gucci's positioning as a luxury brand, the target demographic is likely to be individuals with high disposable income and a propensity for spending on high-end fashion and luxury goods.
